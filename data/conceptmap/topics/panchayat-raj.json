    "summary": "Panchayati Raj evolution: **Art 40 DPSP (1950)** laid foundation but non-justiciable. **Balwant Rai Mehta Committee (1957)** recommended 3-tier system - Rajasthan first to implement (1959). By 1970s, panchayats declined. **Ashok Mehta Committee (1977)** recommended revival & constitutional status. **64th Amendment (1989)** failed in Rajya Sabha. **73rd Amendment (1992)** - LANDMARK - Granted constitutional status by inserting Part IX (Art 243-243O) & 11th Schedule (29 subjects). Mandatory: 3-tier, direct elections, 5-year term, 1/3rd women, SC/ST reservation, State Election Commission, Gram Sabha. Effective April 24, 1993. Revolutionary - 3 million elected representatives (1 million women). **PESA Act (1996)** extended to 5th Schedule areas with tribal safeguards - Gram Sabha supreme, can prevent land alienation. Exam focus: 73rd Amendment provisions (Part IX, 11th Schedule, mandatory features), PESA (Gram Sabha powers), comparison with 74th Amendment (Urban Local Bodies)."
