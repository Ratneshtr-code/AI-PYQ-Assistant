        "summary": "PESA Act 1996 extended Panchayati Raj to 5th Schedule areas with tribal safeguards. Gram Sabha is supreme - must be consulted on land acquisition, natural resources, mining licenses. Can prevent land alienation & restore tribal land. Forest Rights Act 2006 recognizes forest rights of tribals across India (not limited to Scheduled Areas). Two types: Individual Forest Rights (IFR - cultivation, max 4 ha) & Community Forest Rights (CFR - MFP collection, grazing, conservation). Gram Sabha initiates claims process. Both Acts face slow implementation. Land Acquisition Act 2013 requires Gram Sabha consent for acquisition in Scheduled Areas. SC & ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act 1989 prevents atrocities. National Commission for STs (Art 338A) monitors safeguards. STs have 7.5% reservation in jobs & education, 47 Lok Sabha seats reserved."

    "summary": "India has two systems for tribal area administration: **5th Schedule** (10 States in central India) & **6th Schedule** (4 States in North-East). 5th Schedule: President declares Scheduled Areas; Governor has special powers; Tribes Advisory Council (TAC) advises; Land transfer restrictions; PESA 1996 extended Panchayats. 6th Schedule: HIGH autonomy through Autonomous District Councils (ADCs); 10 ADCs in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, Mizoram; ADCs have legislative, judicial, financial powers; Customary law protected; 73rd Amendment excluded. Key Acts: PESA 1996 (Gram Sabha supreme in 5th Schedule areas), Forest Rights Act 2006 (forest rights for tribals - IFR & CFR). 6th Schedule has MUCH greater autonomy than 5th Schedule. Exam focus: Constitutional provisions (Art 244(1), 244(2)), comparison of 5th & 6th Schedules, PESA & FRA provisions, Gram Sabha's role."
