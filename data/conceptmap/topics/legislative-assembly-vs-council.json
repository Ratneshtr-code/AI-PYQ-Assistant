Council can delay Ordinary Bills (3-4 months max) and Money Bills (14 days max) but cannot reject them. Assembly can abolish Council (Art 169) - Council cannot prevent its own abolition. Only 6 States currently have bicameral legislature: Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh. Council has 6 categories of members (Local Bodies, Assembly members, Teachers, Graduates, Nominated). Assembly (5-year term, directly elected, 25+ age) is similar to Lok Sabha; Council (6-year term, indirectly elected/nominated, 30+ age) is similar to Rajya Sabha. Key exam point: Assembly can abolish Council, but Council CANNOT be abolished by itself. Constitutional Amendments ratified ONLY by Assembly, not Council."
