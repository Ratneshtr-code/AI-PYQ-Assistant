DPSPs (Part IV, Art 36-51) are **non-justiciable, positive, society-centric, non-enforceable** directives borrowed from Ireland. **FRs = Means, DPSPs = Ends** (Granville Austin). In conflict, **FRs generally prevail** (Champakam 1951), but **balanced approach** needed (Minerva Mills 1980). Both form **Basic Structure** and are **complementary** - together establish socio-economic democracy. Modern trend: **DPSP goals incorporated into FRs** through Art 21 expansion (livelihood, health, education, environment). **25+ points of distinction** for comprehensive exam answer."
