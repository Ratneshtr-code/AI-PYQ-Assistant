      "**Constitutional vs Procedural**: Only Quorum (Art 100(3)) is in Constitution; Others are in Rules of Procedure & Conduct of Business",
      "**Question Hour Importance**: Most effective tool for executive accountability; Ministers must answer; Can lead to debates",
      "**Zero Hour Uniqueness**: Indian parliamentary innovation (1962); Not found in British Parliament; Most flexible device",
      "**Motions for Control**: Adjournment (censures govt), No-confidence (only LS, can topple govt), Censure (disapproval), Cut (budget reduction)",
      "**Speaker's Power**: Final authority on Point of Order, admitting motions, allowing special mentions; Art 122(1) prevents judicial review of proceedings",
