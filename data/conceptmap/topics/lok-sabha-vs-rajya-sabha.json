LS has exclusive control over Money Bills (Art 110), Budget & Grants (Art 113-114), and can remove government via no-confidence (Art 75(3)). RS can delay Ordinary Bills (6 months max) and Money Bills (14 days max) but cannot reject them. RS has exclusive powers under Art 249 (authorize Parliament to legislate on State List) and Art 312 (create All India Services). Both Houses have equal power in Constitutional Amendments, President's impeachment, and Emergency provisions. LS (543 members, 5-year term, directly elected) represents people; RS (245 members, 6-year term, indirectly elected) represents states. Key exam point: Despite being Upper House, RS is LESS powerful than LS unlike US Senate."
